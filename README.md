# TIC-TAC-TOE
Build a tic-tac-toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions and created an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.

The Python program file containes code that implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user can choose to play against a computer (single player) or against another human (multiplayer). The AI is designed in such a way that it will never let a human win â€“ it will either result in a draw or the AI winning. The game is played on a 3x3 board, and the players are represented by 'X' and 'O'. The user is prompted to input their moves, and the program determines the winner or declares a draw.

The code includes functions for displaying the current state of the board, taking user inputs for moves, implementing the minimax algorithm for the computer's move in single-player mode, and checking for a winning condition or a draw. The main function orchestrates the flow of the game based on user choices for single or multiplayer.
